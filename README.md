# Project Name: MineCreeper
# Author: Zhang Xingjian, China

This is a MineCreeper game based on C++. The interaction is through stdIO. It is also possible that I will make a GUI for it. 

The features include:
1. Difficulty manipulation;
2. Map size manipulation;
3. Allow players to mark a bomb by a flag (To be more specific, one input a negative coordinate to mark);
...

The potential improvenment include:
1. UI is not user-friendly;
2. The number of bombs is determined randomly;
3. rand() of C can be replaced by C++ random function;
